Once, after another interview, Saitama was returning home from one of the streets when he heard people shouting that there was a danger ahead and that everyone was saving, but he was moving on and was meeting a huge monster crab. `I wanted to become a superhero who makes such stamped villains like you ... With one stroke.` He angrily says that he has finished his job search and is distracting the crab himself, Krabinator only beats Saitama several times, saying that he is not a hero, but only a budget, and that he has no chance against him, but it only cost Krabinator to relax, As Saitama grabs one by the eye and pulls it out, thereby defeating the crab monster. After this battle Saitama decides to become a mighty superhero, he starts a daily training schedule, which consisted of 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups and 10 km of running every day. He also ate three meals a day, but only bananas as tomorrow, and also do not use air conditioning to strengthen his moral resistance. These daily activities were very cruel and caused him painful pains, such as muscle pains and internal bleeding. However, Saitama did not give up and continued training day after day to become a superhero.'
