npc_arena_hero_kadash_hype: 'Mighty Kadash does not kill so easily. He is resurrected again and again, until the vital forces leave him definitively. By applying; A series of critical strikes, he will crush any enemy, no matter how many lives he did not need.'
npc_arena_hero_kadash_bio: 'Kadash, also known as the Immortal Horseman, Order Knight is one of the warriors of the order, a skilled swordsman who brings light and peace to the wild and shattered worlds, dispelling the darkness with the shining of his blade. Kadash is the eternal rival of Chaos Knight, for many centuries they fought each other, but no one could take up in this fight. While the wife of Chaos Knigth, the Apocalypse, offered him no help, so that the Chaos knight could finally defeat Kadash. After telling his wife where and when he would ambush Kadash, the Apocalypse went to him. Hardly having envied the Apocalypse, Kadash rushed after her in pursuit, in order to finish with the demon. But she led the Immortal Horseman straight into the trap: it seemed that Kadash overtook her, but the Apocalypse, waving her fiery blade, melted the armor of the warrior. Immediately on Kadash, countless incarnations of the Chaos Knight attacked, shredding his flesh until the warrior fell dead, covered with terrible wounds.|-
- The end of the eternal struggle! - rumbled the deaf voice of the triumphant Knight of Chaos.
But a quiet laugh sounded behind the backs of the illusions of Chaos Knight. The laughter continued to grow. Kadash, having risen from the earth, jumped on a horse and with a swing of a blade has cut all incarnations of Chaos Knight.|-
-No meanness, no darkness, no cunning will not crush the Light. To such as you, never to overcome me. Light will always exist, and even in the densest darkness its spark will dispel the darkness, and no matter how trying the henchmen of Chaos, the Light will always find a loophole!|-
For a moment, the hand of Chaos Knight flinched, but he again clashed with him in a fight. The ringing of the crossed blades, the cackling of horses, the sparks from the blades, gliding over the armor of knights. The apocalypse swung again with the blade, re-melted the armor of the Immortal Horseman, and again he fell from the blow with the sword of Chaos Knight, and again rose, as if nothing had happened, continuing the battle. This battle lasted long, many times Kadash died. But now, he died finally. And the Knight of Chaos, in broken armor, barely holding on to the saddle, paid tribute to his enemy and set off. But Kadash did not die. Stargaizer found his lifeless body and dipped into the streams of energy that pierced the Universe, which brought him back to life. Kadash vowed to take revenge from Chaos Knight. And he had such an opportunity. The universe split, and clashed in the grasp of the forces of Order and Chaos in the arena of the Angels. Responding to the call of Order, Kadash went there to fight in his honor, and at the same time get even with his enemy.'
