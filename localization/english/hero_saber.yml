npc_arena_hero_saber: Saber
npc_arena_hero_saber_hype: 'Saber is effective at all stages of the game. Increasing her armor and damage from mana, she heads the offensive, taking the main blow at herself, or ends the battle with one stroke of Excalibur, bringing down on the command of the enemy a beam of pure light.'
npc_arena_hero_saber_bio: 'Female knights are a rarity, an exception to the rules. However, in the world of Saber, this was not unusual: in the dimension where she was born, even a virgin could become a knight. But Saber, among other things, was an outstanding warrior: she, having existed in our parallel world, took the place of King Arthur. Owning Escalibur, she gained a great power to transform her inner energy into her strength and protection. And her crowning trick is cutting the enemies of Escalibur, feeding the blade with her mana. Thanks to her abilities, she conquered all the kingdoms and became the absolute queen of her world. And the Universe gave her a chance to extend her influence beyond her measurement, opening the doors to the arena of the Angels, where the demigods and the best warriors from the entire space-time continuum decide the fate of all worlds. Saber could not stand aloof from such a massive fight, and, raising Escalibur in the name of Order, rushes into the thick of the battle.'
